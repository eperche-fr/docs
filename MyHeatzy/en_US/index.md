# Configuration

## Plugin Configuration

1. Go to the plugin configuration.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Start the daemon.

If the daemon doesnâ€™t start, the default port (59769) may already be in use. If so, choose another available port (e.g., 59770), save, and restart the daemon. If the issue persists, refer to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

You also need to provide (and save):
- Your Heatzy account email.
- Your Heatzy login password.
- Refresh rate: cron 5, 10, 15 or 30 minutes (only one active cron). Keep the daily cron as well.

Once the information is correct, the devices will sync automatically. Close the configuration page. If the equipment does not appear, refresh the page, or check the logs.
